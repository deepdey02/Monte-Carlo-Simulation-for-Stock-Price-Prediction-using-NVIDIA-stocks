Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Prediction
This project uses a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast potential future stock prices for a given company, using NVIDIA (NVDA) as a case study.
The simulation helps to visualize the range of possible price outcomes and understand the inherent uncertainty in stock market movements.

How It Works
The simulation follows these main steps:

Data Acquisition: Historical stock data for NVIDIA (NVDA) is fetched using the yfinance library.
Calculating Key Metrics: Daily returns are calculated from the historical data. The mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma) of these returns are then computed to serve as the key parameters for the simulation.
Simulation Run: The core of the program generates thousands of random price paths. For each path, a random daily return is generated based on the mean and standard deviation of historical returns. 
This random return is then applied to the previous day's price to simulate the next day's price.
Visualization: All the simulated paths are plotted on a single graph, providing a visual representation of the wide range of potential future prices. 
The final predicted price is the average of all the final prices from each simulated path.

Key Concepts
Monte Carlo Simulation: A computational technique that uses repeated random sampling to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted.
Daily Returns: The percentage change in the stock price from one day to the next.
Drift (mu): The average daily return, which represents the expected direction or trend of the stock price over time.
Volatility (sigma): The standard deviation of the daily returns, which measures the randomness or risk associated with the stock price. Higher volatility means greater price fluctuations.
